We want a ball rolling down an infinite slope. We can't actually have an infinite slope because computers have finite memory.
Having something just really big would be inefficient. To solve this, we will only generate chunks of terrain as they are needed.
As such, we need some way of obscuring terrain at the bottom, otherwise the player could see where the terrain ends.
My plan is to do some sort of mist thing at the bottom. The best way to do this would be to have the mist move with the player
a fixed distance away from them. This would prevent the player from seeing where terrain hasn't been generated yet.

Terrain behind the player will be destroyed. The plan is to have two chunks of exist at one time. When the player moves off
from the first chunk to the second, the first will be destroyed and another will be generated.
